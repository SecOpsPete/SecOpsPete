## 🔎 Threat Hunting Labs

- 🕵️‍♂️ **[Unauthorized TOR Activity Detection](https://github.com/SecOpsPete/threat-hunting-scenarios/blob/main/unauthorized-tor-activity)**  
  Investigates unsanctioned installation and usage of the TOR browser using endpoint telemetry and network activity. Demonstrates detection of silent installation, anonymous traffic over TOR relay ports, and artifacts suggesting user concealment attempts.

- 🛡️ **[PwnCrypt Ransomware Detection](https://github.com/SecOpsPete/threat-hunting-scenarios/blob/main/pwncrypt-ransomware-detection/README.md)**  
  Detects file encryption activity, delivery via PowerShell, and execution of the `pwncrypt.ps1` ransomware script using Microsoft Defender telemetry and MITRE ATT&CK mapping.

- 🧪 **[Suspicious Insider Exfiltration Attempt](https://github.com/SecOpsPete/threat-hunting-scenarios/tree/main/insider-data-exfil)**  
  Investigates potential insider threat activity using Microsoft Defender for Endpoint, correlating file, process, and network telemetry to detect staged data exfiltration.

- 🔎 **[Threat Hunt: PowerShell Port Scanning](https://github.com/SecOpsPete/threat-hunting-scenarios/tree/main/port-scanning-detection)**  
  Detection and investigation of internal lateral movement using obfuscated scripts.

- 🌐 **[Threat Hunt: Exposed VM Brute Force](https://github.com/SecOpsPete/threat-hunting-scenarios/tree/main/brute-force-detection)**  
  Analysis of brute-force behavior on a cloud-based Linux server.

## 🧪 Incident Response Labs

- 🌍 **[Impossible Travel Detection with Microsoft Sentinel](https://github.com/SecOpsPete/incident-response-sentinel/tree/main/impossible-travel-detection-sentinel)**  
  Detects anomalous sign-in behavior across distant geographic locations in short timeframes. Implements a Sentinel analytics rule and KQL-based investigation to identify potential account compromise. Follows the NIST IR framework for containment, validation, and closure.

- ⚡ **[PowerShell Suspicious Web Request Detection](https://github.com/SecOpsPete/incident-response-sentinel/tree/main/ps-suspicious-web-request)**  
  Simulates post-exploitation behavior where PowerShell downloads remote payloads using `Invoke-WebRequest`. Includes Sentinel rule creation, incident triage, and MDE-based containment following the NIST IR framework.

- 🔐 **[Brute Force Detection with Microsoft Sentinel](https://github.com/SecOpsPete/incident-response-sentinel/tree/main/brute-force-detection-sentinel)**  
  Detects multiple failed login attempts from the same remote IP using KQL and Microsoft Sentinel analytics rules.

## ⚠️ Vulnerability Management Projects

- 🔧 **[Vulnerability Management Program Implementation](https://github.com/SecOpsPete/vulnerability-management-projects/tree/main/vulnerability-management-program)**  
  A complete documentation-based approach to launching an internal vulnerability management program.

- 💻 **[Programmatic Remediation Scripts (PowerShell)](https://github.com/SecOpsPete/vulnerability-management-projects/tree/main/programmatic-remediation-scripts)**  
  Automated scripts for common CVE remediation and configuration hardening.

- 💬 **[Prompt Engineering References](https://github.com/SecOpsPete/vulnerability-management-projects/tree/main/prompt-engineering-references)**  
  ChatGPT prompts used to generate and refine PowerShell remediation scripts, demonstrating structured problem-solving and AI-assisted development.

## 🛠️ Security Tools

- 🛠️ **[Process Investigation with PowerShell](https://github.com/SecOpsPete/cybersecurity-tools/blob/main/process-investigation-windows)**
  Identify, analyze, and validate suspicious Windows processes using native PowerShell tools and reputation checks.

- 🔐 **[GPG Signature Verification Guide](https://github.com/SecOpsPete/cybersecurity-tools/blob/main/gpg-verification-guide)**  
  A step-by-step guide for verifying file authenticity and integrity using GPG with real-world examples.

- 🧪 **[File Integrity Verification (SHA256)](https://github.com/SecOpsPete/cybersecurity-tools/tree/main/file-integrity-verification)**  
  Validates that a downloaded file hasn’t been altered using SHA256 hash checking in PowerShell.

- 🔐 **[SSH Key Authentication Lab](https://github.com/SecOpsPete/cybersecurity-tools/tree/main/ssh-key-authentication-lab)**  
  A hands-on guide to configuring and using SSH key-based authentication.

## 🏠 Home Network Security

- 🔐 **[Secure SOHO Network](https://github.com/SecOpsPete/secure-soho-network/blob/main/secure-soho-network-lab)**  
  Documents the design and implementation of a secure small office/home office (SOHO) network. Features include IoT segmentation, guest SSID isolation, firewall configuration, endpoint protection with Malwarebytes, NordVPN, BitLocker encryption, and a Raspberry Pi syslog server for centralized logging.

- 🖨️ **[Printer Firewall Hardening](https://github.com/SecOpsPete/cybersecurity-tools/blob/main/printer-firewall-hardening)**  
  Secure a network printer by applying precise Windows Defender Firewall rules to block public exposure while preserving vendor updating & management functionality.
  
- 🛡️ **[Secure Network Security Profile](https://github.com/SecOpsPete/secure-soho-network/tree/main/network-security-profile)**  
  Evaluates and documents the security posture of a SOHO network with layered defenses including VLAN segmentation, endpoint hardening, router firewall rules, BitLocker encryption, and syslog integration via Raspberry Pi. Includes visual diagrams and implementation walkthrough.
